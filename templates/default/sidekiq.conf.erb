# This example config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage Sidekiq instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# NOTE: This is heavily inspired by Sidekiq's example sidekiq.conf
#
# Save this config as /etc/init/sidekiq-APPNAME.conf then mange sidekiq with:
#   sudo start sidekiq-APPNAME
#   sudo stop sidekiq-APPNAME
#   sudo status sidekiq-APPNAME
#
# or use the service command:
#   sudo service sidekiq-APPNAME {start,stop,restart,status}

# TERM and USR1 are sent by sidekiqctl when stopping sidekiq.  Without declaring these as normal exit codes, it just respawns.
